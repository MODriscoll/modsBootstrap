## modsBootstrap

modsBootstrap is a simple static library that provides the basic interface for creating an OpenGL application.  
This project is an assignment for implementing computer graphics in C++.

TODO List:
- Make window wrapper so more than one window can be active at a time
- Input class that is an extension (not derived) for the window wrapper so the window wrapper is cluttered.
The input class should handle all input and allow bindings of actions and axes
- Base application class that handles all systems
- Base class for buffers, it should handle the binding and unbinding for the buffers

Wish List:
- Game object (Actor) feature
- A component feature
