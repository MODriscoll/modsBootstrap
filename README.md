TODO List:
- Make window wrapper so more than one window can be active at a time
- Input class that is an extension (not derived) for the window wrapper so the window wrapper is cluttered.
The input class should handle all input and allow bindings of actions and axes

Wish List:
- Game object system
- A component system
